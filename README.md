# Data Science Job Market Dashboard

This project analyzes over 2,500 data science job listings to uncover trends in salary, experience level, remote work distribution, and job title demand. Using tools like Python, SQL, and Tableau, the project explores what factors contribute to higher salaries and which roles are most in demand across locations.
